# Data Science Mentorship

This repository contains the work done during my DS mentorship. My goal is to practice and showcase my abilities in an organized and professional manner. A brief description of each project is shown below. The utils folder contains functions I have created.  If you have any questions about my work, please feel free to email me at lee.d.stetson@gmail.com.
